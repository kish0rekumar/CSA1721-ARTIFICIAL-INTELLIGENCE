% Forward chaining predicate
forward_chaining(Fact) :-
    rule(Fact, Conclusion),  % Check if there's a rule matching the given fact
    \+ fact(Conclusion),     % Check if the conclusion is not already a fact
    asserta(fact(Conclusion)), % Assert the conclusion as a new fact
    forward_chaining(Conclusion). % Recursively apply forward chaining on the new fact

forward_chaining(_). % Base case: If no more rules match, stop forward chaining

OUTPUT:
% Example query to start forward chaining with the fact "raining"
% ?- forward_chaining(raining).
